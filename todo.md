- [ ] **Core Layout:** A faithful visual and functional replication of the Visual Studio Code editor.
  - [ ] File Tree: A collapsible side panel on the left for navigating project files and folders.
  - [ ] Editor: The central component for viewing and editing code, with support for syntax highlighting, code folding, and multiple cursors.
  - [ ] Chat Window: A dedicated panel on the right for interacting with the ETHCO AI agent.
  - [ ] Iconography: A top bar with clear and functional icons for common actions.
  - [ ] Terminal: An integrated terminal at the bottom of the window for command-line operations.
  - [ ] Onboarding: An initial "Open Folder" prompt to establish the project workspace.

- [ ] **Professional Aesthetics:**
  - [ ] Dark Mode: A visually appealing and professional dark theme as the default.
  - [ ] Consistency: Adherence to VS Code's design language for a familiar user experience.

### 2. Agent Mode with Gemini 1.5 Pro

- [ ] Conversational AI: Leverage the advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro for seamless human-AI collaboration on programming tasks.
- [ ] Task-Oriented Dialogue: The AI agent will be trained through carefully crafted prompts to understand and execute coding-related instructions within the ETHCO environment.
- [ ] Cursor-like Functionality: The agent's interactions and capabilities will mirror and extend the feature set of the Cursor AI-powered editor.

### 3. Integrated Toolset for LLMs

- [ ] **File System Operations:** Empower the AI agent with the ability to directly manipulate the project's file structure.
  - [ ] File and Folder Management: Create, delete, and rename files and folders.
  - [ ] Content Modification: Add to or replace the content of existing files.
  - [ ] Directory Traversal: Read files with line numbers and list the contents of directories.

- [ ] **Terminal Execution:**
  - [ ] Local Terminal Integration: Provide the AI agent with the capability to execute commands in the user's local terminal to run projects, install dependencies, and perform other command-line tasks.

- [ ] **End-to-End Browser Automation:** Grant the LLM human-like control over a web browser for tasks requiring web interaction.
  - [ ] Navigation: Open and navigate to specific URLs.
  - [ ] Interaction: Scroll through web pages, fill out forms, and click on various elements.
  - [ ] Information Extraction: Take screenshots of web pages and extract content into markdown or text files.
  - [ ] Web Search: Perform search queries and process the results.

### 4. Real-time Visual Feedback

- [ ] Tool Usage Indicators: Display live visual icons to indicate which tools the AI agent is currently utilizing.
- [ ] Code Change Highlighting: Clearly visualize code modifications in the editor, with green highlighting for added lines and red for removed lines, similar to Git diff indicators.

## End-to-End Phase-Based Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundational UI/UX Development

- [x] Objective: Create a static yet visually precise replica of the VS Code interface.
- [ ] Key Tasks:
  - [x] Develop the core layout components: File Tree, Editor, Chat Window, and Terminal panels.
  - [ ] Implement the dark mode theme and professional aesthetics.
  - [ ] Integrate top functional icons.
  - [ ] Ensure the layout is responsive and visually consistent.

### Phase 2: Core Editor and File System Functionality

- [ ] Objective: Transform the static UI into a functional code editor with basic file operations.
- [ ] Key Tasks:
  - [ ] Integrate a code editor library (e.g., Monaco Editor, the engine that powers VS Code).
  - [ ] Implement the "Open Folder" functionality to load a project directory.
  - [ ] Develop the file tree navigation, allowing users to open and view files.
  - [ ] Enable basic file editing capabilities within the editor.

### Phase 3: Agent and Communication Integration

- [ ] Objective: Connect the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to the chat window and establish a communication pipeline.
- [ ] Key Tasks:
  - [ ] Set up the backend infrastructure to handle API calls to Gemini 1.5 Pro.
  - [ ] Implement the chat interface for user-agent interaction.
  - [ ] Develop the initial prompt engineering to guide the LLM's behavior in the ETHCO environment.
  - [ ] Enable the agent to send and receive messages in the chat window.

### Phase 4: Tool Integration - File Execution

- [ ] Objective: Grant the AI agent control over the file system.
- [ ] Key Tasks:
  - [ ] Develop and integrate the file execution tools: create/delete files and folders, replace/add content, and read/list directories.
  - [ ] Train the LLM to understand and use these file manipulation commands based on user requests.

### Phase 5: Tool Integration - Terminal and Browser

- [ ] Objective: Expand the agent's capabilities to include terminal and browser control.
- [ ] Key Tasks:
  - [ ] Integrate a web-based terminal emulator and connect it to the local system.
  - [ ] Develop the browser automation tools for navigation, interaction, and data extraction.
  - [ ] Train the LLM to utilize both the terminal and browser tools effectively to complete complex coding tasks.

### Phase 6: Visual Feedback and Refinement

- [ ] Objective: Implement the visual feedback mechanisms and polish the user experience.
- [ ] Key Tasks:
  - [ ] Develop and integrate the live visual icons for tool usage.
  - [ ] Implement the real-time code change highlighting in the editor.
  - [ ] Conduct thorough user experience testing and refine the overall aesthetics and usability.
